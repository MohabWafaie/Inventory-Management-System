## 🔄 Permit Types Explained

- **Supply Permit**: Adds new stock to a warehouse.  
- **Withdraw Permit**: Removes stock from warehouse and tracks client info.  
- **Transfer Permit**: Moves stock between two warehouses.

Each permit is linked to detailed product entries with:
- Production/expiry dates  
- Movement logs  

---

## 📌 Important Notes

- Each permit automatically updates:
  - Stock levels in `ProductInWarehouse`  
  - Movement records in `ProductMovement`  
  - Related records like `SupplyPermitProduct` and `WithdrawPermitProduct` link the permit to stock entries  

- All quantity changes affect `ProductInWarehouse` and are reflected in the `ProductMovement` table.  
- **Transfer Permits** automatically:
  - Deduct from source warehouse  
  - Add to destination warehouse  

- Validation prevents over-withdrawing beyond available stock.  
- Nullable relationships are handled cautiously to avoid null reference issues.
